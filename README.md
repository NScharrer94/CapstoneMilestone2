# CapstoneMilestone2

- What is working on your project so far?
The main menu functions as expected. I am able to add patients, and exiting the main menu functions and gives the correct exit message. I am happy that I have a solid foundation at this point in the project and am looking forward to ironing out my last few issues.

- What are the current issues with your project?
 As of right now, my list patient does not function, even after adding a patient. Additionally, I am unable to tell if if searching a patient works, as well as deleting a patient as I do not recieve any feedback from the program, however I do not recieve an error message like I do when using the List patient function. I would like to look back in my code and figure out how to add prompts notifying me that these functions were successful.

- Which part of the project you plan to work on next?
  The following two weeks will consist of personalizing my project, as well as fixing the broken list patient function, and getting feedback regarding if the search and delete functions were successful. Additionally, I realized I spelled managment wrong in my Vi, so I will probably copy the code into a new Vi with correct spelling. I am also troubleshooting how to add files to Github, I'm really not sure what I'm doing wrong, and have watched multiple tutorials that use both the password and Personal Access Key functions, yet no matter what I try I recieve errors when trying to import my files. I would like to figure this out by when the second Milestone is due so I have code to present, but this has proven to be extremely difficult for me for some reason.
